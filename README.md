Developed character count, reverse string and palindrome check with Java Graphical User Interface(GUI): JFrame and JLabel functions

In this project, we will learn about the basics of handling JFrame and JLabel functions as well as checking characters in Java.

Jframe is implemented as an instance of the JFrame class, it is a window that has decorations such as a border, 
a title, and supports button components that close or iconify the window. Applications with a GUI usually 
include at least one frame. Applets sometimes use frames, as well.

The JLabel Component descends from JComponent and is used to create text labels.
The object of JLabel class is a component for placing text in a container. It is used to display a single 
line of read only text. The text can be changed by an application but a user cannot edit it directly. It inherits JComponent class.
